# üèπ UltimateBows

Adds new bows in your Minecraft server. Basically my first plugin, it will remain active, but I will only update it when there's a bug or a new feature proposal, even I find it useless.

![Demonstration](./images/demo.gif)

## Commands

It has only one command which is ```/ubows give <bowName>```, the permission for that command is ```ultimatebows.give```.

## Bows

These are the different bows (write them like this in the command, for example ```/ubows give playerBow```).

| Bow                  | Permission                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ```destructionBow``` | ```ultimatebows.use.destructionbow``` |
| ```playerBow```      | ```ultimatebows.use.playerbow```      |
| ```teleportBow```    | ```ultimatebows.use.teleportbow```    |
| ```explosiveBow```   | ```ultimatebows.use.explosivebow```   |
| ```mobBow```         | ```ultimatebows.use.mobbow```         |
| ```lightningBow```   | ```ultimatebows.use.lightningbow```   |
| ```fireBow```        | ```ultimatebows.use.firebow```        |
| ```waterBow```       | ```ultimatebows.use.waterbow```       |
| ```lavaBow```        | ```ultimatebows.use.lavabow```        |

You can also type ```all``` to get every bow, for example ```/ubows give all```.

## Compatibility

The plugin should work from version ```1.13.2``` to version ```1.19.4```.
