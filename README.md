# üèπ UltimateBows

Adds new bows in your Minecraft server. Basically my first plugin, it will remain active, but I will only update it when there's a bug or a new feature proposal, even I find it useless.

![Demonstration](./images/demo.gif)

## Commands

It has only one command which is ```/ubows give <bowName>```, the permission for that command is ```ultimatebows.give```.

## Bows

These are the different bows (write them like this in the command, for example ```/ubows give playerBow```)
* ```destructionBow```
* ```playerBow```
* ```teleportBow```
* ```explosiveBow```
* ```waterBow```
* ```lavaBow```

## Compatibility
I only tested it on Minecraft 1.19.2, didn't test other versions, by the way it should work on most versions since it only adds some bows and effects.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. I obviously accept any constructive criticism.
